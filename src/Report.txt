Description of approach used (max 200 words):
I used some hybridization methods in this algorithm.
I create initial population by random creation or greedy algorithm.
Deciding which one to use is depends on a probability which is called pBestValue.
After creation I create offspring from sorted population only best one are able to
create offspring. Then I used elitism so I replaced the worst individuals of my
population with offspring. Then I applied Flip mutation to this new population with
some probability. Executed this method until max number of iteration reached.


All relevant parameters and their settings:
    int pmutation = 8;                 // Probability of a chromosome will get a mutation //out of 10
    int popSize = 1200;                //Basically Population Size
    int maxExecution = 100;            //Termination Criteria
    double offSpringRatio = 0.5;       //Offspring ratio like here popsize is 1200 so 0.5*1200=600 offspring will be created in each iteration.
    int pBestValue = 15;               //Probability of chromosome creation that will use greedy start //out of 100
    double initChangeRatio = 0.4;      // hybird // what percentage of population will be copyied from previous runs.
    int iterationCount = 3;            //Iteration count of algorithm  -> get first results and use some of them in next iterations as initial.
